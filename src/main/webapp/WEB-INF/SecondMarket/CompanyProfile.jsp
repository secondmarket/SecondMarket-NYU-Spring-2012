									<h4>Company Overview</h4>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">Facebook is the world's
										largest social network, with over 840 million users.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">Facebook was founded by
										Mark Zuckerberg in February 2004, initially as an exclusive
										network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks,
										half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a
										Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends
										Dustin Moskowitz and Chris Hughes to help build Facebook, and
										within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">The original idea for
										the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips
										Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to
										every student as a way for students to get to know their
										classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper
										book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">With this success,
										Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to Palo Alto for
										the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg
										ran into the former cofounder of Napster, Sean Parker. Parker
										soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working
										together. Parker provided the introduction to their first
										investor, Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal and managing
										partner of The Founders Fund. Thiel invested $500,000 into
										Facebook.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">With millions more
										users, Friendster attempted to acquire the company for $10
										million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and
										subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from Accel
										Partners, at a valuation of around $100 million. Facebook
										continued to grow, opening up to high school students in
										September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing
										feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25
										million in funding from Greylock Partners and Meritech
										Capital, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and
										Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about
										$525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work
										networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks.
										Finally in September 2006, Facebook opened to anyone with an
										email address.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">In the summer of 2006,
										Yahoo attempted to acquire the company for $1 billion dollars.
										Reports actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal
										agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when
										Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800
										million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal. Yahoo later
										offered $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo
										down and earned instant notoriety as the "kid" who turned down
										a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down
										an acquisition offer; Viacom had previously unsuccessfully
										attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March,
										2006.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">One sour note for
										Facebook has been the controversy with social network
										ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark
										Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their
										original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has gone to
										court, and has now been resolved.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">Notwithstanding this
										lingering controversy, Facebook's growth in the fall of 2007
										was staggering. Over 1 million new users signed up every week,
										200,000 daily, totaling over 50 million active users. Facebook
										received 40 billion page views a month. Long gone were the
										days of Facebook as a social network for college students. 11%
										of users are over the age of 35, and the fastest growing
										demographic is users over 30. Facebook has also seen huge
										growth internationally; 15% of the user base is in Canada.
										Facebook users' passion, or addiction, to the site is
										unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day
										and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook.
										Facebook is 6th most trafficked site in the US and top photo
										sharing site with 4.1 billion photos uploaded.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">Based on these types of
										numbers, Microsoft invested $240 million into Facebook for 1.6
										percent of the company in October 2007. This meant a valuation
										of over $15 billion, making Facebook the 5th most valuable US
										Internet company, yet with only $150 million in annual
										revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely
										driven by the desire to outbid Google.</p>
									<p class="sm-ellipsis sm-more-item">Facebook's competitors
										include MySpace, Bebo, Friendster, LinkedIn, Tagged, Hi5,
										Piczo, and Open Social.</p>
